Data
We will start by loading the following data into Tableau.

Name	Path	Value
Amazon Video	1	3.1
Amazon Video	270	3.1
Http	1	6.1
Http	270	6.1
Netflix	1	37.1
Netflix	270	37.1
Other	1	35.8
Other	270	35.8
YouTube	1	17.9
YouTube	270	17.9



Calculated Fields


With our data set loaded into Tableau, we are going to create the following Calculated Fields and Bins:

Path (bin)

Right click on Path, go to Create and select Bins…
In the Edit Bins dialogue window:
Set New field name to Path (bin)
Set Size of bins to 1
Click Ok
Note: The Path (bin) will allow us to use a table calculation to create additional data points between 1 and 270.

Index

INDEX()-1

TC_Value

WINDOW_MAX(SUM([Value]))

TC_Max Value

WINDOW_MAX(SUM([Value]))

TC_Step Size

[TC_Value]/[TC_Max Value]

TC_Rank

RANK_UNIQUE([TC_Value],'asc')

X

SIN([Index]*PI()/180*[TC_Step Size])*[TC_Rank]

Let us spend a little time here explaining how we are using our other Calculated Fields:

Using our Path (Bins) we are going to use densification to get additional points
We need to convert percentages to Radians by multiplying by PI() and then dividing by 180.
Y

COS([Index]*PI()/180*[TC_Step Size])*[TC_Rank]

So now that we have created a lot of Calculated fields, we will now put this together into a Worksheet.

Worksheet
We will now build our worksheet:

Drag Name onto the Color Mark
Drag Path (Bin) onto the Columns
Right click on Path (Bin) and check Show Missing Values
Drag Path (Bin) onto the Detail Mark
Change the Mark Type to Line
Drag X onto Rows
Right click on X, go to Compute Using, select Path (Bin)
Drag Y onto Columns
Right click on Y, go to Compute Using, select Path (Bin)
You should see the following:


We will now edit the calculated fields to complete the Visualisation:

Right click on X and select Edit Table Calculations
In Nested Calculation select TC_Max Value
Click on Specific Dimensions and select Path (Bin) and Name
Ensure Name is on top
In Nested Calculation select TC_Rank
Click on Specific Dimensions and select Path (Bin) and Name
Ensure Name is on top
In At the Level select Name
Right click on Y and select Edit Table Calculations
In Nested Calculation select TC_Max Value
Click on Specific Dimensions and select Path (Bin) and Name
Ensure Name is on top
In Nested Calculation select TC_Rank
Click on Specific Dimensions and select Path (Bin) and Name
Ensure Name is on top
In At the Level select Name
You should now see the following visualisation:


Adjusting the Visual
We will now do the following to get the look that we require:

Remove all Grid Lines
Remove Axis headers
Drag Name onto Label
Drag TC_Value onto Label
Click on Label, select Line Ends and untick Label end of line
End the Label Text
Edit the colors
Edit the Tooltips
Increase the size of the lines
After which you should have the following:
